One player of each team is selected as the team's clue giver; the others are field operatives. </p>\n<p> Twenty-five code name cards, each bearing a word, are laid out in a 5×5 rectangular grid, in random order. A number of these words represent red agents, a number represent blue agents, one represents an assassin, and the others represent innocent bystanders. </p>\n\n<p> The teams' clue givers are given a randomly-dealt map card showing a 5×5 grid of 25 squares of various colors, each corresponding to one of the code name cards on the table. </p>\n<p> Teams take turns. On each turn, the appropriate clue giver gives a verbal hint about the words on the respective cards. Each hint may only consist of one single word and a number. </p>\n<p>The clue giver gives a hint that is related to as many of the words on his/her own agents' cards as possible, but not to any others – lest they accidentally lead their team to choose a card representing an innocent bystander, an opposing agent, or the assassin.\n\nThe hint's word can be chosen freely, as long as it is not (and does not contain) any of the words on the code name cards still showing at that time. Code name cards are covered as guesses are made.\n</p>\n<p> The hint's number tells the field operatives how many words in the grid are related to the word of the clue. It also determines the maximum number of guesses the field operatives may make on that turn, which is the hint's number plus one. Field operatives must make at least one guess per turn, risking a wrong guess and its consequences. They may also end their turn voluntarily at any point thereafter.</p>\n<p>After a clue giver gives the hint with its word and number, their field operatives make guesses about which code name cards bear words related to the hint and point them out, one at a time. When a code name card is pointed out, the clue giver covers that card with an appropriate identity card – a blue agent card, a red agent card, an innocent bystander card, or the assassin card – as indicated on the clue givers' map of the grid. If the assassin is pointed out, the game ends immediately, with the team who identified him losing. If an agent of the other team is pointed out, the turn ends immediately, and that other team is also one agent closer to winning. If an innocent bystander is pointed out, the turn simply ends.\n</p>\n<p>The game ends when all of one team's agents are identified (winning the game for that team), or when one team has identified the assassin (losing the game).</p>\n  </div>;\n};\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./src/app/components/index_home.jsx","import React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport { browserHistory, Link, withRouter } from 'react-router';\nimport { connect } from 'react-redux';\nimport { bindActionCreators } from 'redux';\nimport { startNewGame  } from '../actions/firebase_actions';\n\n\nclass NewGame extends Component {\n\n    constructor(props) {\n        super(props);\n        this.onFormSubmit = this.onFormSubmit.bind(this);\n        this.state = {\n            gameroom: '',\n            playerName: '',\n            team: 'red'\n        };\n    }\n\n    onFormSubmit(event) {\n        event.preventDefault();\n        // redirects to gameroom:\n        let roomName = this.state.gameroom;\n        let gameroomRoute = '/game/' + roomName + '/' + this.state.playerName + '/' + this.state.team;\n\n        this.props.startNewGame(({room: this.state.gameroom, player: this.state.playerName, team: this.state.team}));\n        this.props.history.push(gameroomRoute);\n    }\n\n    handleGameroomChange = (event) => {\n        this.setState({gameroom: event.target.value});\n    }\n\n    handleNameChange = (event) => {\n        this.setState({playerName: event.target.value});\n    }\n\n    handleTeamChange = (event) => {\n        this.setState({team: event.target.value});\n    }\n\n    render() {\n        return (\n            <div className=\"col-md-4\">\n                <form id=\"frmLogin\" role=\"form\" onSubmit={this.onFormSubmit}>\n                    <h2>Create a New Game!</h2>\n                    <div className=\"form-group\">\n                        <label htmlFor=\"txtEmail\">Enter the Name of Your Game Room</label>\n                        <input\n                          value={this.state.gameroom} onChange={this.handleGameroomChange} \n                          className=\"form-control\" id=\"txtEmail\" ref=\"email\" placeholder=\"Gameroom Name\"\n                          name=\"email\"\n                        />\n                    </div>\n                    <div className=\"form-group\">\n                        <label htmlFor=\"txtEmail\">Enter Your Name</label>\n                        <input\n                          value={this.state.playerName} onChange={this.handleNameChange} \n                          className=\"form-control\" id=\"txtEmail\" ref=\"email\" placeholder=\"My Name\"\n                          name=\"email\"\n                        />\n                    </div>\n                    <div className=\"form-group\">\n                        <label htmlFor=\"txtPass\">What Team are you Playing On?</label>\n                        <select value={this.state.team} onChange={this.handleTeamChange} >\n                            <option value=\"red\">Red</option>\n                            <option value=\"blue\">Blue</option>\n                        </select>\n                    </div>\n                    <button type=\"submit\" className=\"btn btn-default btn-block\">Play!</button>\n                    <br />\n                </form>\n            </div>\n\n        );\n    }\n\n}\n\nfunction mapDispatchToProps(dispatch) {\n    return bindActionCreators({\n        startNewGame,\n    }, dispatch);\n}\n\nfunction mapStateToProps(state) {\n    return { gameState: state.gameState };\n}\n\nexport default connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(NewGame);\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./src/app/components/newgame.jsx","module.exports = {\n\n  // Change this to your firebase configuration!
